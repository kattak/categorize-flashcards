# categorize-flashcards
Tinder-style game for Quizlet flashcards that can be categorized. 

##What's the problem?
Quizlet has "100 million user-generated" flashcard sets, and six custom games available on their site.

However, many users create flashcard sets with duplicate definitions.

I wanted to create an app to help people learn content that is *categorizeable* in a fun Tinder-like interface.

##What does this app do?
1. Choose a topic.  (Search functionality TBD)

2. The app parses Quizlet flashcards into categories. 

3. Each card is presented with two of the possible categories.

4. Swipe (or click) right or left to select the right category.


##Technologies used
- Vanilla JS & JQuery
