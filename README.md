# Categorize Flashcards
Tinder-style game for Quizlet flashcards that can be categorized. 

## What's the problem?
Quizlet has "100 million user-generated" flashcard sets, and six custom games available on their site.

However, many users create flashcard sets with duplicate definitions.

Here's an example - these flashcards help you learn how to categorize Spanish words by their masculine (el) or feminine (la) prefixes.
